Require: Oracle Java install on each node.

1, Config /etc/hosts file on each host.
	Insert these lines in /etc/hosts on each host.
	ip_nodex: Ip address of each node.	

		ip_node1 node1
		ip_node2 node2
		ip_node3 node3

2, Install Oracle Java on each node.	

		apt-get update
		add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
		apt-get install oracle-java12-installer -y

	Check Java install successfull
		java -version


3, Download zookeeper and install. Perform on each node.
	
	- Select zookeeper version you want to install(It's up to you.).
	 In this tutorial I use version 3.5.5 and download it to /opt

		wget -P /opt http://mirror.downloadvn.com/apache/zookeeper/stable/apache-zookeeper-3.5.5-bin.tar.gz

	- After finished download, extrac it.
	- Prepare data directory: It's up to you.
	  In this tutorial I make a diriectory: /data/zookeeperX

	  	mkdir -p /data/zookeeperX (replace X by 1 or 2 or 3 depend on node.)


4, Prepare zookeeper config file

	Zookeeper use any file config that you select to start it. In this tutorial I make a file called:
	zookeeper1.properties for node1, zookeeper2.properties for node2, zookeeper3.properties for node3
	and put it in /opt/zookeeper_dir/conf

		# The number of milliseconds of each tick
		tickTime=2000
		# The number of ticks that the initial 
		# synchronization phase can take
		initLimit=10
		# The number of ticks that can pass between 
		# sending a request and getting an acknowledgement
		syncLimit=5
		# the directory where the snapshot is stored.
		# do not use /tmp for storage, /tmp here is just 
		# example sakes.
		dataDir=/data/zookeeperx
		# the port at which the clients will connect
		clientPort=2181
		# the maximum number of client connections.
		# increase this if you need to handle more clients
		#maxClientCnxns=60
		#
		# Be sure to read the maintenance section of the 
		# administrator guide before turning on autopurge.
		#
		# http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_maintenance
		#
		# The number of snapshots to retain in dataDir
		#autopurge.snapRetainCount=3
		# Purge task interval in hours
		# Set to "0" to disable auto purge feature
		#autopurge.puirgeInterval=1

		server.1=node1:2888:3888
		server.2=node2:2888:3888
		server.3=node3:2888:3888

		authProvider.1=org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.SASLAuthenticationProvider
		requireClientAuthScheme=sasl
		jaasLoginRenew=3600000

	Make a file called: myid and put it in zookeeper data directory. In this tutorial is /data/zookeeper

		echo X > /data/zookeeper/myid (replace X by 1 or 2 or 3 depend on each node.)

5, Start service and check status
	
	In order to start service, on each node we perform command like follow.

		/opt/zookeeper_dir/bin/zkServer.sh start /opt/zookeeper_dir/conf/zookeeperX.properties (replace X by 1 or 2 or 3 depend on node you start service)

	In order to check status service 

		/opt/zookeeper_dir/bin/zkServer.sh status /opt/zookeeper_dir/conf/zookeeperX.properties (replace X by 1 or 2 or 3 depend on node you start service)
